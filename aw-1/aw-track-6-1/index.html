 <h5>Well, hello there. You're about to go on the journey of a very young, <br />
     very inquistive, very imaginative girl named Alice. Find the clickable <br />
     object or text that will take you onwards on your journey and navigate <br />
     your way through Wonderland. From this point forwards you experience <br />
     Wonderland from the point of view of little Alice Kingsley. <br /> <br /> <br />
     You're taking a little nap on your sisters lap in a garden on your <br />
     estate on a warm sunny day. Suddenly, you wake up to see a rabbit in an <br />
     overcoat. How strange, you think to yourself. You up and begin to chase him <br />
     through the garden. He has a pocketwatch that he seems to be pointing at <br />
     and motioning to you. All of a sudden, he jumps into a little rabbit hole <br />
     You begin to peer in after him, when suddenly... <br /> <br /> <br />
     Open the door to find out.</h5>
