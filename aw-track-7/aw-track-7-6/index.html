<h5>"Once upon a time there were three little sisters
<br /> and their names were Elsie, Lacie and Tillie and
<br /> they lived at the bottom of a well."
<br /><br />
What did they live on?
<br /><br />
"They lived on treacle."
<br /><br />
They couldn't have done that, they'd have been ill.
<br /><br />
"So they were, very ill."
<br /><br />
But why did they live at the bottom of a well?
<br /><br />
"It's a treacle-well."
<br /><br />
There's no such thing!
<br /><br />
"If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the
<br /> story for yourself."
<br /><br />
No, please go on, I won't interrupt again.
<br /><br />
"And so these three sisters - they were learning to
<br /> draw, you know -"
<br /><br />
What did they draw?
<br /><br />
"Treacle"
<br /><br />
But I don't understand! Where did they draw
<br /> the treacle from?
<br /><br />
